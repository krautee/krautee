**krautee/krautee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on PlutoF Biodiversity Data Space, ornithological data related to some University of Tartu and Vaibla Bird Observatory projects.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: by e-mail or phone that are available if you google my name.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have few old 8" floppy disks at home.
